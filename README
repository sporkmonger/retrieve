== Description

Retrieve is an extensible library for retrieving resources identified by a
URI. Retrieval methods are registered to URI schemes.

== Features

* Access any resource with a client defined for its scheme.
* Read and write to anything that can be addressed by a URI.
* Easily implement additional clients for other URI schemes.
* Supports "http" and "file" schemes by default.
* The HTTP client is faster and more efficient than Net::HTTP.

== Example Usage

  res = Retrieve.open("file:///home/sporkmonger/todo.txt", :mode => :read)
  #=> #<Retrieve::Resource:0x847c2c URI:file:///home/sporkmonger/todo.txt>
  res.read
  #=> "TODO: Write some code."
  res.close

  body, status = nil
  Retrieve.open("http://www.google.com/", :method => :get) do |resource|
    body = resource.read
    status = resource.metadata[:status]
  end
  body
  #=> GOOGLE_HOMEPAGE_HTML
  status
  #=> 200

== Requirements

* addressable
